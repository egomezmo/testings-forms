If you need help making a major decision, hire conflict-free advisors who charge a fee for their time. Work in partnership with advisors — don’t abdicate control.\n        </p>\n\n          <p><b>Invest in yourself and others.</b>\n            Invest in your education, your health, and your relationships with family and friends.
